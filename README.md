Project,,Face Detection Project
,,This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV.
Features,,Captures video from a webcam.
Features,,Detects faces in each frame using a Haar cascade classifier.
Features,,Draws rectangles around the detected faces.
Features,,Displays the live video output with detected faces.
Features,,Provides instructions for installation and running.
Installation,,Install OpenCV:
Installation,,Follow the official installation instructions for your operating system: https://opencv.org/
Installation,,Download Haar Cascade Classifier:
Installation,,Download the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file from the OpenCV GitHub repository: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
Installation,,Place it in a folder named data within the project directory.
Running the Code,,Open a terminal or command prompt.
Running the Code,,Navigate to the project directory.
Running the Code,,Execute the script using Python:
Running the Code,,Bash
Running the Code,,python face_detection.py
Running the Code,,Use o c√≥digo com cuidado.
Usage,,A window titled "FaceDetect" will open, displaying the live webcam feed.
Usage,,Rectangles will be drawn around detected faces.
Usage,,Press "Q" or "Esc" to quit the program.
Additional Notes,,Ensure you have a webcam connected and working properly.
Additional Notes,,If you encounter errors, check OpenCV installation and file paths.
Additional Notes,,Experiment with different Haar cascade classifiers for different types of object detection.
Enhancements,,Multiple Face Tracking: Track individual faces across frames for more engaging interactions.
Enhancements,,Face Recognition: Identify specific individuals using trained face recognition models.
Enhancements,,Performance Optimization: Explore techniques to improve detection speed and accuracy.
Enhancements,,User Interface: Create a graphical interface for easier control and configuration.
